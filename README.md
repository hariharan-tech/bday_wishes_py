# Python Email Birthday Wishes Project

This program is written for sending Birthday wishes to my collegemates
on their birthday using the branch allotment pdf that was sent by the college management.
This program is not automated as of now, so it will send Birthday wishes emails 
only if I run it everyday.

This program uses smtp and email library to send emails. I have stored the students
data from the pdf in a notepad by just copy and pasting it. 
The text file that contains the data isn't provided due to Privacy reasons.

The students data in the notepad is of the format :   
roll_no reg_no dig_id name email_id gender dob section. 

This doesn't contain the branch, so wrote a new python program (which I havent 
uploaded here) which was able to add the branch of each student correctly.

Now the students data is in format:
roll_no reg_no dig_id name email_id gender dob branch section

Now inside the main python file(which is the uploaded here), we start a for loop 
so read the notepad .txt file, and save the information of each student in a 
dictionary with the dictionary's key is the email id and the value is a list 
that contains: the student_name, dob, branch and section. The below image shows
how the dictionary is used to store data.

We then use a while true loop to make the program be more interactive for the user. Now a input is asked from 
and according to the input, the necessary if statements are run. 

Now the main part where the email gets sent is at the sendemail function and the 
option number 2 that the user inputs when the program starts running. When option 2,
is entered, the user is asked with the date in the format (mm/dd/yyyy), the user can 
input just the month and day in this format so that he can email anyone who's Birthday
is on different years like 2001 and 2002. After asking the date, the user is shown with 
the person's name, branch, section and date of birth and user is asked if they are willing
to send a wishes email to that person. If the user inputs 'y' the email is sent by calling
the sendemail function. For sending emails, we must turn on the Less secure app access on your google accounts 
security section.

Now lets move to how this email text is generated. The sendemail functions takes email_id,
student_name, branch and section as input. Then the subject string is generated by using the line
subject_str="Happy birthday "+name

Now some more strings are generated as shown in the picture below.

Then this final_string is used as the content of the email. The data representation of how
the email content is set, "To" and "From" email address and the subject string is set.

Then this server.send_message(email) command sends the email with the generated subject and the 
content. The email content is also printed to the user.

NOTE: The Branch Allotment PDF and the notepad file is not included here due to security reasons.
